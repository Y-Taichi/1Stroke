## About This Project

This project is a game where you compete using a single continuous stroke.
Your line is your score — with only one stroke, try to be as creative as possible and draw the best image you can.
By playing repeatedly, you'll naturally improve your drawing skills. I originally created this because I wanted to draw the map of Hokkaido beautifully.

The code was written by Gemini and the-pen.
