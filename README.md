## About This Project

This project is a game where you compete using a single continuous stroke.
Your line is your score — with only one stroke, try to be as creative as possible and draw the best image you can.
By playing repeatedly, you'll naturally improve your drawing skills. I originally created this because I wanted to draw the map of Hokkaido beautifully.

The code was written by Gemini and the-pen.

## Localization / 日本語対応

This repository includes a Japanese translation of the user-facing UI and documentation.

- Japanese README: `README.ja.md` (日本語ドキュメント)
- The app includes a language switcher (top-right) so you can toggle between English and Japanese in the UI.
